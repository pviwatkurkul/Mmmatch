## What it does
Our mobile platform is designed to actively combat food waste by offering personalized recipe recommendations through an interactive chatbot. Once you receive your tailored suggestions, you engage with them in a dynamic, Tinder-style interface—swiping left to like a recipe and right to reject it. All your preferred recipes are saved to your favorites for easy access. Plus, you can browse and explore recipes that have been liked and shared by other users, further enhancing your culinary experience while contributing to reducing food waste

## How we built it
We developed the mobile site using Next.js, leveraging its fast and dynamic capabilities for a responsive front-end, while Supabase provided a robust backend with real-time database, authentication, and storage features. The design process began with crafting wireframes and high-fidelity mockups in Figma, which enabled us to iterate quickly and ensure a user-friendly, visually appealing interface. Additionally, we mapped out the app’s workflows and user journeys through FigJam, allowing our team to collaborate effectively and align on the overall structure before diving into development. This approach ensured both a smooth design process and a seamless final product.
